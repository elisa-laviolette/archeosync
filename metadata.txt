about=ArcheoSync is a QGIS plugin designed to streamline archaeological field recording workflows. It allows users to export GIS layers, raster basemaps, and custom forms to field tablets (e.g., using QField), and then import the recorded data back into the main QGIS project. The plugin facilitates round-trip data transfer, ensuring spatial and attribute data integrity, detecting conflicts or duplicate entries, and assisting in the validation of new data. It supports modular, square-meter-based recording typical in prehistoric excavation projects.
